- **Small Projects/Scripts** - Minimal set for simple work
- **Jupyter Notebooks/Data Analysis** - Specialized for data work  
- **Medium to Large Projects** - Full professional development practices
- **Production/Enterprise Projects** - Maximum rigor and security

## Key Features

### Applicability System
Each instruction section includes clear applicability markers showing which project types it applies to:
- Clear project type classifications
- Section-by-section applicability markers
- Ready-to-use log template for documenting instruction usage

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Documentation and output formatting
- Project planning and logging
- Version control best practices
- Build and test automation
- Code quality standards
- Security best practices
- Jupyter notebook guidelines

## Usage

### For AI Assistants
1. Reference these instructions when starting new projects
2. Determine project type and applicable instruction sections
3. Use the provided log template to document which instructions apply
4. Follow the relevant guidelines throughout development

### For Development Teams
1. Adopt instructions appropriate for your project type
2. Customize sections as needed for your specific requirements
3. Use as a checklist for code reviews and project setup
4. Reference for establishing team coding standards

## Getting Started

When starting a new project:

1. **Assess Project Type**: Determine which category your project falls into
2. **Document Applicability**: Copy the log template and check applicable instructions
3. **Set Up Logging**: Create `log.md` file for tracking changes and progress
4. **Follow Guidelines**: Apply relevant instructions throughout development

### Log Template

Copy this template to your project's `log.md` file:

```markdown
