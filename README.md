## Getting Started

## Quick VSCode Setup

**For immediate use with VSCode and AI assistants:**

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev
   git clone https://github.com/maeehart/vscode_instructions.git
   ```

2. **Add to VSCode settings** (`settings.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "copilot.context.additionalFiles": [
       "~/dev/vscode_instructions/*.md",
       ".github/instructions/*.md"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **In your project**, create a reference:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/instructions
   ln -s ~/dev/vscode_instructions/general_coding_instructions.md .github/instructions/
   ```

4. **Copy log template**:
   ```bash
   cp ~/dev/vscode_instructions/log_template.md ./log.md
   ```

### Initial Project Setup

### Initial Project Setup

When starting a new project with these instructions:

1. **Assess Project Type**: Determine which category your project falls into
2. **Set Up Instructions**: Choose one of the VSCode integration methods above
3. **Create Log File**: Set up `log.md` for tracking changes and progress
4. **Document Applicability**: Use the log template to check applicable instructions
5. **Configure VSCode**: Ensure your editor can access and reference the instructions
6. **Follow Guidelines**: Apply relevant instructions throughout development

### VSCode Workflow Integration

#### For AI Assistant Users:
1. **Reference instructions** in your prompts: "Please follow the coding instructions in `.github/instructions/general_coding_instructions.md`"
2. **Context inclusion**: Ensure your AI assistant can access the instructions file
3. **Regular reviews**: Periodically check that generated code follows the applicable guidelines

#### For Manual Development:
1. **Use as checklist**: Review relevant sections before starting new features
2. **Code review reference**: Check against applicable guidelines during reviews
3. **Team alignment**: Ensure all team members are familiar with applicable instructions

#### Recommended VSCode Extensions:
- **Markdown All in One**: For editing instruction files
- **GitLens**: For following version control best practices
- **Todo Tree**: For tracking todos in log files
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: For code organization
- **Error Lens**: For immediate error feedback

### Log Template

Copy this template to your project's `log.md` file:

```markdown
